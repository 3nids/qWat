qWat: QGIS Water Module

INSTALL
-------

In your shell:

 git clone https://github.com/qwat/qWat
 cd qWat

If you haven't added your ssh key to github, then you need to tell git to access the data-model submodule through https.
Edit the .gitmodules file in the qWat folder and replace the url value from git@github.com:qwat/qwat-data-model.git to https://github.com/qwat/qwat-data-model.git

 git submodule init
 git submodule update

In order to create the database model you need to:

 - create a postgresql database
 - install the postgis extension

You can choose whatever name for the database and whatever user as its owner.
The script that is used to create the database model looks for the .pg_service.conf file.
Assuming you named your database qwat, edit the ~/.pg_service.conf file and make it look like:

 # Qwat service name
 [qwat]
 #enter your database ip
 host=192.168.0.1
 #database name
 dbname=qwat
 port=5432
 user=postgres
 #you can also add your password if you like
 password=YourPassword

Now go to the 'data-model' directory and run the 'create_schemas.bash' script:

 cd data-model
 ./create_schemas.bash

After your model gets created, in QGIS you should now be able to connect to the database by creating a new connection with Name=qwat, Service=qwat, SSL mode=prefer.

If that works then open the qwat.qgs project in QGIS.
